# VSCode_Python_Setup

This is a simple guide for setting up VSCode for Python.

I have seen many guides on this same topic but I found many of them unsatisfying.

So, I decided to make my own guide!

#### NOTE: This guide is for Windows based machines.[ Although, most of the steps should be the same for Mac/Linux Machines.]

#### This guide also assumes that you have Python installed on your system already.

### Step 1: Installing VSCode:

This Step is pretty self - explanatory. To download VSCode, go to https://code.visualstudio.com/

Download the file as per your device and run it to set it up.

After the installation is complete, you should be greeted with a screen like this:

Now, click on the Python Extension by Microsoft (It should be the first one)

Click on install and wait for the installation to finish.

Now we have the capability to edit Python Code on VSCode properly!

Some of the features the Python Extension provides are:
- Code Completion
- Code formatting
- Code Linting
- Tests
- Refactoring & More!

#### Step 3: Making our workflow better:

Now that we have installed the Python extension, we can run move onto the next part: 
### Installing and using a Language Server

#### What is a Python Language Server?

A language server, to put it simply is a piece of software that makes our code writing experience better.

It contains some custom features like code analysis, finding references and infering types.

A Python Language Server is a language server is specific to Python and contains Python specific features.

The most up-to-date Python Language Server as of the making of this guide is  ```Pylance```
